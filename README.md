# NeuralNetworks 
#### This is code for the building a Standard Neural Networks with Keras.

The following notebooks and pictures are used to explain in the article called **"Coding a Neural Networks Quick" in Nutshell** which is published in **AnalyticsVidhya Medium Publications**.

The Notebook explains about neural network building using sequential model, activation function, densing layers and so on.
